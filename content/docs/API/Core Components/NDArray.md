C++17 Header-only library for basic operations with multidimensional arrays.

## Basic usage

`green-ndarray` is a C++ header-only library that provides basic routines to operate with multi-dimensional data.
It allows to create a multidimensional array that owns memory, as well as an array for an allocated memory.

To add this library into your project, first.

```CMake
Include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
        green-ndarray
        GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/Green-Phys/green-ndarray.git
        GIT_TAG origin/main # or a later release
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(green-ndarray)
```
Add predefined alias `GREEN::NDARRAY` it to your target:
```CMake
target_link_libraries(<target> PUBLIC GREEN::NDARRAY)
```
And then simply include the following header:
```cpp
#include <green/ndarray/ndarray.h>
```

***
Here is a small example of some possible operations:


```cpp
using namespace green::ndarray;

// Create empty 5d array of doubles
ndarray<double, 5> array1;

// Resize array to a new shape
array1.resize(3,4,5,6,7);

// Set all elements of array to be 3

array1 = 3.0;

// Create 5d array of doubles of shape (3,4,5,6,7) and set all elements to 1
ndarray<double, 5> array2(3,4,5,6,7);
array2 = 1.0;

// Take a 2-dimesional slice of array1 at (1,2,3) leading index
// Both array1 and array3 point at the same memory region.
// array3 has a non-zero offset from the beginning of a memory region
ndarray<double, 2> array3 = array1(1,2,3);

// Get an element of array2 at (1,2,3,4,5) coordinate

double value = array2(1,2,3,4,5);
```

Assignment operation does not do deep copy of the data. Example below shows possible scenarios
for assignment and deep-copy of the data.

```cpp
// Create empty 5-dimensional array
ndarray<double, 5> array4;

// array4 shares memory with array1, any changes in array4 will be changes in array1
array4 = array1;

// Create empty 5-dimensional array
ndarray<double, 5> array5;

// Make a deep copy of array1 and assign it to array5

array5 = array1.copy();

// Create an array of the same shape as array1
ndarray<double, 5> array6(3,4,5,6,7);

// Assign all elements of array1 to array6
array6 << array1;

```

Keep in mind that `operator<<` requires both arrays to have the same shape. This check is enfourced in `Debug` mode and.
omitted in `Release` mode for performance reasons.

***

To perform basic mathematic operations you need to include `<green/ndarray/ndarray_math.h>` header.

The following operations are implemented
- Addition and Subtraction
- Inplace Addition and Subtraction
- Addition and Subtraction of a scalar
- Multiplication and Division by a scalar
- Inplace operations with scalar
- Negation of an array

Datatypes of two operands do not need to be the same. For inplace operations value type of a RHS should be.
convertible to a value type of a RHS array. For non-inplace operation an array of common value type for both operands.
