The Nevanlinna Analytic Continuation method is described in detail in
the following two papers:

<https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.056402>

<https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.104.165111>

There is also an undergraduate thesis that has many more details:
