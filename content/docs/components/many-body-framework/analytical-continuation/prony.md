The Prony Analytic Continuation method, also called the Minimal Pole Method, is described in detail in
the following papers:

1. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.035154 (scalar-valued version)

2. https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14000 (matrix-valued version)

Green provides a pedagogical implementation of the method as it was submitted to the journal. The implementation is generic; follow the instructions in the README to get started. A more elaborate version that seamlessly integrates with the GREEN code will be presented at a later time.

To get started, head to the repositories at:

1. https://github.com/Green-Phys/PronyAC (scalar-valued version, deprecated as it is a special case of MiniPole)

2. https://github.com/Green-Phys/MiniPole (matrix-valued version)

Then follow the instructions in the README. File [issues](https://github.com/Green-Phys/PronyAC/issues) and ask [Lei Zhang](mailto:lzphy@umich.edu), [Sergei Iskakov](mailto:siskakov@umich.edu) or [Emanuel Gull](mailto:egull@umich.edu).
